# 🧮 Project Cost Estimator using GenAI (Grok)

A web-based tool built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, designed to estimate software project costs based on user-defined parameters like team composition, rates, and duration. It uses the **Grok Generative AI model** to suggest cost optimizations and allows exporting breakdowns as PDF and Excel reports.

- Input roles (Developer, QA, Designer, etc.) and timelines
- Auto-calculated project cost breakdown
- GenAI-powered optimization suggestions using **Grok**
- Export cost details as PDF and Excel
- Multi-page Streamlit app with a clean UI
